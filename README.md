Steganography involves concealing data within other files, messages, images, or videos to obscure its presence. Unlike cryptography, which renders a message unreadable, steganography aims to make communication undetectable. The term originates from Greek, combining "steganos" (covered) and "graphein" (writing).

Here is a small project that hides your data in a photo (steg.py) and then decrypts it (decr.py).
